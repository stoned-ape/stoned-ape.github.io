        Below I have added an interactive demo for the pathfinding algorithm.  Click on a square to block the path and see how the algorithm adapts.  Click on the square again to unblock it.

        There are two fundamental algorithms at play here, A* pathfinding and the recursive backtracker which generates the mazes.
        The recursive backtracker will visit every cell with an even numbered x and y coordinate on the grid
        exactly once and paint it white.  Aside from the edges, for any cell there are four possible cells the backtracker can visit
        next, two cells up, two cells down, two cells left and two cells to the right.  It will first rule out any cells it has already visited
        then recursively visit all remaining cells in random order.  When the backtracker moves from one cell to the next it paints
        the cell between them white.  This method ensures that there is exactly one path between any two even numbered cells.  With
        this algorithm I can generate arbitrarily large mazes, which are pretty intriguing to look at.
